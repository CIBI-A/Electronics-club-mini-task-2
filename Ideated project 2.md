__Ideation of the project 'Electronic juice vending machine'__

The web link of the project description: [Electronic juice vending machine](https://nevonprojects.com/android-powered-juice-vending-machine/)

__Problem statement:__ To have an automatic juice vending machine which pours the juice if a coin is inserted. Also, it must provide options for the user and must detect the presence of a glass on its own.

__Ideation phase:__ The basic mechanism is:

Coin module and bluetooth module => Microcontroller => Glass detector module => Microcontroller => Motor module

In the suggested project, the components used are:

ATMEGA328P microcontroller

Bluetooth module for wireless communication

IR sensors for glass detection

| Component | Feasibility | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
|Microcontroller|Quite easy if familiar with its basics| Our solution could be even more versatile if we can hack on the microcontroller|Usually tough to start with since they are PLDs basically and demand some programming skills beforehand|
|Wireless communication module|Tough to start with and demand some dedicated components|Learning outcomes are high|Require some money as components may be costly|
|Glass detection| One of the easiest modules to hack on with| Cost can be significantly reduced|Precision in measuring the glass distance may be lost to some extent|
