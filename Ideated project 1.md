__Ideation of the project 'Wireless auto power trip'__

The web link to the project description: [Wireless auto power trip](http://www.ripublication.com/aeee/42_pp%20%20327-332.pdf)

__Problem statement:__
To create an automatic gas leak detector and power tripper which detects the presence of a gas leak and if any is present, will automatically shut down the power and also activate an alarm.

__Ideation phase:__
The basic mechanism of this project is simple:

Gas sensor => Transmission end microcontroller => WC transmitter module => WC receiver module => Receiver end microcontroller => Alarm system and Tripper switch

In the given link, they have used:

MQ-6 gas sensor

RF communication module for wireless communication

Suggested PIC16F877A or Intel 8051 microprocessors

| Component | Feasibility | Advantages | Disadvantages |
________________________________________________________
|Microcontroller|Quite easy if familiar with its basics| Our solution could be even more versatile if we can hack on the microcontroller|Usually tough to start with since they are PLDs basically and demand some skill beforehand|
